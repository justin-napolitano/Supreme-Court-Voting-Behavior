# Abstract


 
    In this paper, I compare the the predicative power of the legal and attitudinal models to determine which is most descriptive of the voting behavior of United States Supreme Court Justices.

    I will test each model by attempting to predict the outcome of the upcoming case Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commision [^masterpiece] [^date]  using the framework proposed by proponents of each model.
