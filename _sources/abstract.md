# Abstract


 
In this paper, I compare the the predicative power of the legal and attitudinal models to determine which is most descriptive of the voting behavior of United States Supreme Court Justices.

I will test each model by attempting to predict the outcome of the case Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commision [^masterpiece] using the framework proposed by proponents of each model. [^date]
