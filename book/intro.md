# Supreme Court Voting Behavior

## Project Focus
The focus of this project is to serve as a repository for theories of Judicial Voting Behavior.  


## Background
I began this project as an indepent research paper that I had written during my senior year of university studies under the tutelage of Dr. Lanier of the University of Central Florida. 

I later published it on github as a portfolio piece. 

## Open Source Project
I am now seeking to expand it with the aid of other researchers.  

If you would like to contribute please email Justin Napolitano at napolitano.just@gmail.com.  

You may also clone this repository and work directly with the jupyter-books tools.  I will post the links to the installation and configuration pages soon.  

I have studied the Attitudinal Models as proposed by a number of theorists [^see-the-attitudinal-model].  Therefore, my work is heavily biased.

Contributions are greatly appreciated.
